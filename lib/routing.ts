/**
 * Pure routing helpers extracted from the Fresh middleware (`main.ts`).
 *
 * These functions encode two decisions the middleware makes for every request:
 *
 *   1. {@link needsFullState} — whether the request needs the *full* resolved
 *      state (active registry, participants, entities, …) or only the user.
 *      Full-state resolution is the expensive path; lightweight paths skip it.
 *
 *   2. {@link routeGuard} — the auth/redirect rules (login redirect when
 *      anonymous, bounce authed users off login pages, etc.). Returns a
 *      redirect target string, or `null` when the request should fall through
 *      to the route handler.
 *
 * Keeping them here — as pure functions of `(path, flags)` — lets the test
 * suite lock the rules down so a careless edit to `main.ts` can't silently
 * change who gets redirected where.
 *
 * NOTE: `/api/default-split` in {@link needsFullState} is intentionally kept
 * for backward compatibility. The real route lives at
 * `/api/registries/default-split`, which is already covered by the broader
 * `/api/registries` prefix — so the entry is redundant but harmless.
