/**
 * Pure row-mapping helpers.
 *
 * Each function converts a raw result row (`Record<string, unknown>`,
 * snake_case columns, numerics as strings) into the app's typed model. They
 * have no I/O and no side effects — extracted from `lib/store.ts` so they can
 * be unit-tested without a database.
 *
 * Rows arrive from two sources with slightly different numeric shapes:
 *   - `pg` returns NUMERIC columns as **strings** (e.g. `"100.50"`).
 *   - Supabase Realtime `postgres_changes` payloads deliver them as **numbers**
 *     (JSON), e.g. `100.5`.
 * The numeric parsers below use {@link num} to handle both shapes defensively.
 *
 * Branches worth knowing (locked down by `rows_test.ts`):
 *   - `rowToTransaction.splitJson`: parsed from string when the driver returns
 *     a string, used as-is when already an object.
 *   - `rowToTransaction.recurringGroupId`: falls back to the row id when the
 *     group id is null (load-bearing for spawn-candidate grouping).
 *   - `rowToRegistry.defaultSplit`: three-way branch — falsy → null, string →
 *     JSON.parse, object → as-is.
