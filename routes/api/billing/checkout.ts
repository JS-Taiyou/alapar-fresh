/**
 * GET /api/billing/checkout?interval=monthly|yearly
 *
 * 302 to the dashboard-configured Polar Checkout Link, for the CURRENT user.
 * A subscription is per-user: one purchase unlocks Pro on every registry the
 * subscriber owns (joining groups stays free, as always).
 *
 * Why GET (not POST): this is a pure redirect — no state changes on our side
 * — which is exactly what GET semantics describe. Browsers can't be sent to a
 * POST target via location.href, and the pricing page navigates with plain
 * links, so GET keeps the flow simple. The worst a forged GET can do is
 * bounce someone to a Polar checkout page; the subscribing identity is the
 * session's user, resolved server-side (never from the query string).
 *
 * ALREADY-SUBSCRIBED GUARD: a user with a live subscription (per the same
 * matrix that gates registries — active/trialing, paid-through, or grace) is
 * bounced back to /pricing with a notice instead of reaching Polar. Without
 * this, a stale tab or a hand-typed URL could buy a SECOND subscription for
 * the same customer: two charges, and our per-user mirror would only track
 * whichever webhook landed last. Upgrades are a plan SWITCH on the existing
 * subscription (/api/billing/switch), never a second checkout.
 *
 * 503 when billing env vars are unset: surfacing misconfiguration beats a
 * broken redirect to a URL we can't build.
